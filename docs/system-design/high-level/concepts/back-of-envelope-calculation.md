## Theory

Back of envelope calculation is a technique used to quickly estimate values and check the feasibility of a system design. It involves making reasonable approximations and simplifying assumptions to get rough, order-of-magnitude answers.

Some common approximations:

- **Seconds in a day:**  
    $24 \times 60 \times 60 = 86,400 \approx 100,000$ (1 Lakh)

- **Bytes and Bits:**  
    $1$ Byte $= 8$ bits (sometimes approximated as $10$ bits for easier calculations)

These quick calculations help engineers estimate storage, bandwidth, or processing requirements without needing precise numbers. The goal is to validate ideas and catch obvious issues early in the design process.
